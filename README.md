# Training a Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network with EEG XB-Baseline Driving data to predict Driving Fatigue:

1. The preprocessing of the EEG data is performed in matlab and matlab code can be found indata_preparation. 
2. HRNN keras script is stored in keras-model 
3. SVM model for classification with feature selection is stored in SVM-model 

# Installation and Dependancies:

1. python
2. tensorflow
3. keras. 
4. matlab for data preprocessing 
5. EEGLab - matlab package (optional) for data visualization
