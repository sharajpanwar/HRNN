# Training a Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network with EEG XB-Baseline Driving data to predict Driving Fatigue:

1. The preprocessing of the EEG data is performed in matlab and matlab code can be found in data_preparation. 
2. HRNN keras script is stored in keras-model 

# Installation and Dependancies:

1. python 3.6.4
2. tensorflow 1.12
3. keras 2.2.4 
4. matlab for data preprocessing 
5. EEGLab - matlab package (optional) for data visualization
